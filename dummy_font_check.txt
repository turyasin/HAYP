// This file is a placeholder. 
// I will write the binary content of the font here if read_url_content succeeds.
// Since read_url_content returns text usually, this might be tricky for binary.
// However, the tool `read_url_content` says "Converts HTML to markdown". It might corrupt binary data.
// A better way: I can use `curl` or `wget` via `run_command` to download the file directly!
